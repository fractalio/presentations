    Why, What and How ?
    
    ----

    ## Our Goal
    - Build a basic presentations library
    - A simpler self run alternative of slides.com 
    - Actually slides.com is limited. This tool is much better
    - Get you excited to go try out & learn more about presentations
    So lets get you exited.

    ## What is Presentations

    - Self hosted and Free (both as in freedom and cost)
    - High availability
    - Community driven and Licenced under GNU/GPL
