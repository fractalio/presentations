## PRESENTATIONS

The world started of talking of ideas through images and later with presentations. The presentation world tough started with Marcrosoft Poweerrpooint , it later led to the revolution of LibreOffice an FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). Tough the amazing LibreImpress with the remote control tool was awesome, the pain of carrying the presentation everywhere, and people still not using libreoffice, was still a problem. 

Then there came the advent of web based presentations. reveal Js, impress js, deck js are some of the most commonly used presentation tools.

And people have been using git-pages as a way to write their blog. Some of those smart people out there have also used git-pages to publish their presentations. This repo is one such idea to bring presentations to git-pages and the amazing markdown.


This repo is aiming to make creating any of those presentations very simple as just typing down the content of the presentation.
